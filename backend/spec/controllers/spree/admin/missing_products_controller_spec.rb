# There is the stub_authorization call. This call is not triggered for this test because
# the load_resource filter in Spree::Admin::ResourceController is prepended to the filter chain
# this means this call is triggered before the authorize_admin call and in this case
# the load_resource filter halts the request meaning authorize_admin is not called at all.
