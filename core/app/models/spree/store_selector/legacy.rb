# frozen_string_literal: true

# This class provides the old behaviour for finding a matching Spree::Store
# based on a request.
#
# To enable this, somewhere inside config/initializers/ add
#
#     Spree::Config.current_store_selector_class = Spree::StoreSelector::Legacy
#
# This classes behaviour is somewhat complicated and has issues, which is why
# it has been replaced with Spree::StoreSelector::ByServerName by default.
#
# It will:
# * Find a "store_key"
#   * from the HTTP_SPREE_STORE header, if it exists
#   * or the server's domain name if HTTP_SPREE_STORE isn't set
# * Find a store, using the first match of:
#   * having a code matching the store_key exactly
#   * having a url which contains the store_key anywhere as a substring
#   * has default set to true
#
