# The reason for variant properties not being associated with variants
# (either directly or through an association table) is performance.
#
# Variant properties are intended to be applied to a group of variants based
# on their option values. If there were thousands of variants that shared the
# same option value, attempting to associate a variant property with that
# group of variants would be problematic in terms of performance.
#
# An added benefit to this approach is not having to associate existing variant
# properties with newly created variants. If the variant has the option values
# targeted by the rule, the properties will automatically apply to the variant.
