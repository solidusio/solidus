  # Option types denote the different options for a variant. A typical option
  # type would be a size, with that option typeâ€™s values being something such
  # as "Small", "Medium" and "Large". Another typical option type could be a
  # color, such as "Red", "Green", or "Blue".
  #
  # A product can be assigned many option types, but must be assigned at least
  # one if you wish to create variants for that product.
