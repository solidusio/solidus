  module Stock
    # A simple implementation of Stock Coordination
    #
    # The algorithm for allocating inventory is naive:
    #   * For each available Stock Location
    #     * Allocate as much on hand inventory as possible from this location
    #     * Remove the amount allocated from the amount desired
    #   * Repeat but for backordered inventory
    #   * Combine allocated and on hand inventory into a single shipment per-location
    #
    # Allocation logic can be changed using a custom class (as
    # configured in Spree::Config::stock_allocator_class )
    #
    # After allocation, splitters are run on each Package (as configured in
    # Spree::Config.environment.stock_splitters)
    #
    # Finally, shipping rates are calculated using the class configured as
    # Spree::Config.stock.estimator_class.
