    hints:
      spree/calculator:
        shipping_methods: This is used to calculate the shipping rates on a per order or per package rate.
        tax_rates: The "Default Tax" calculator is used for both sales tax (United States-style taxes) and value-added tax (VAT). Typically this calculator should be the only tax calculator required by your store. "Flat Fee" can be used for any taxes that require a flat fee be charged to the customer.
      spree/price:
        country: 'This determines in what country the price is valid.<br>Default: Any Country'
        master_variant: Changing master variant prices will not change variant prices below, but will be used to populate all new variants
        options: These options are used to create variants in the variants table. They can be changed in the variants tab
      spree/product:
        available_on: This sets the availability date for the product. If this value is not set, or it is set to a date in the future, then the product is not available on the storefront.
        discontinue_on: This sets the discontinue date for the product. If this value is set to a date, then the product is not available on the storefront from that day on anymore.
        promotionable: 'This determines whether or not promotions can apply to this product.<br>Default: Checked'
        shipping_category: 'This determines what kind of shipping this product requires.<br> Default: Default'
        tax_category: 'This determines what kind of taxation is applied to this product.<br> Default: %{default_tax_category}'
      spree/shipping_method:
        available_to_all: Uncheck to select specific stock locations this shipping method will be available in.
      spree/stock_location:
        active: 'This determines whether stock from this location can be used when building packages.<br> Default: Checked'
        backorderable_default: 'When checked, stock items in this location will default to allowing backorders.<br> Default: Unchecked'
        check_stock_on_transfer: 'When checked, inventory levels will be checked when performing stock transfers.<br> Default: Checked'
        fulfillable: 'When unchecked, this indicates that items in this location don''t require actual fulfilment. Stock will not be checked when shipping and emails will not be sent.<br> Default: Checked'
        propagate_all_variants: 'When checked, this will create a stock item for each variant in this stock location.<br> Default: Checked'
        restock_inventory: 'When checked, returned inventory can be added back to this location''s stock levels.<br> Default: checked'
      spree/store:
        available_locales: This determines which locales are available for your customers to choose from in the storefront.
        cart_tax_country_iso: 'This determines which country is used for taxes on carts (orders which don''t yet have an address).<br> Default: None.'
        code: An identifier for your store. Developers may need this value if you operate multiple storefronts.
        default_currency: This determines which currency will be used for the storefront's product prices. Please, be aware that changing this configuration, only products that have prices in the selected currency will be listed on your storefront. <br><br>This setting won't change the default currency used when you create a product. For that, only the global `Spree::Config.currency` is taken into account.
        vat_id: Enter your VAT-ID without the Country Prefix (eg IT for Italy or DE for Germany) but solely the identification string.
      spree/tax_category:
        is_default: When checked, this tax category will be selected by default when creating new products or variants.
      spree/tax_rate:
        tax_rate_level: Item-level taxes will be applied as adjustments on line items and shipments. Order-level taxes will create an adjustment on the order. Care should be taken when chosing order-level adjustments as they aren't considered in refunds or in discounts. The default is item-level.
        validity_period: This determines the validity period within which the tax rate is valid and will be applied to eligible items. <br> If no start date value is specified, the tax rate will be immediately available. <br> If no expiration date value is specified, the tax rate will never expire
      spree/variant:
        deleted: Deleted Variant
        deleted_explanation: This variant was deleted on %{date}.
        deleted_explanation_with_replacement: This variant was deleted on %{date}. It has since been replaced by another with the same SKU.
        shipping_category: 'This determines what kind of shipping this variant requires.<br> Default: Use shipping category of the product associated with this variant'
        tax_category: 'This determines what kind of taxation is applied to this variant.<br> Default: Use tax category of the product associated with this variant'
