## Solidus 1.3.0 (unreleased)

## Solidus 1.2.0 (unreleased)

*   Admin menu has been moved from top of the page to the left side.

    * Submenu items are accessible from any page. See [the wiki](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/wiki/Upgrading-Admin-Navigation-to-1.2)
       for more information and instructions on upgrading.
    * [Solidus_auth_devise](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus_auth_devise)
      should be updated to '~> 1.3' to support the new menu.
    * Added optional styles to the admin area to advance [admin rebrand](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/issues/520).
      To use the new colors, add `@import 'spree/backend/themes/blue_steel/globals/_variables_override';`
      to your `spree/backend/globals/variables_override`.

*   Removed deface requirement from core

    Projects and extensions which rely on deface will need to add it explicitly
    to their dependencies.

*   `testing_support/capybara_ext.rb` no longer changes capybara's matching
    mode to `:prefer_exact`, and instead uses capybara's default, `:smart`.

    You can restore the old behaviour (not recommended) by adding
    `Capybara.match = :prefer_exact` to your `spec_helper.rb`.

    More information can be found in [capybara's README](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara#matching)

*   Fixed a bug where sorting in the admin would not save positions correctly.
    [#632](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/632)

*   Included (VAT-style) taxes, will be considered applicable if they are
    inside the default tax zone, rather than just when they are the defaut tax
    zone. [#657](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/657)

*   Update jQuery.payment to v1.3.2 (from 1.0) [#608](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/608)

*   Removed Order::CurrencyUpdater. [#635](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/635)

*   Removed `Product#set_master_variant_defaults`, which was unnecessary since master is build with `is_master` already `true`.

*   Improved performance of stock packaging [#550](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/550) [#565](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/565) [#574](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/574)

*   Replaced admin taxon management interface [#569](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/569)


## Solidus 1.1.0 (2015-11-25)

*   Address is immutable (Address#readonly? is always true)

    This allows us to minimize cloning addresses, while still ensuring historical
    data is preserved.

*   UserAddressBook module added to manage a user's multiple addresses

*   GET /admin/search/users searches all of a user's addresses, not
    just current bill and ship addresss

*   Adjustment state column has been replaced with a finalized boolean column.
    This includes a migration replacing the column, which may cause some
    downtime for large stores.

*   Handlebars templates in the admin are now stored in assets and precompiled
    with the rest of the admin js.

*   Removed `map_nested_attributes_keys` from the Api::BaseController. This
    method was only used in one place and was oblivious of strong_params.

*   Change all mails deliveries to `#deliver_later`. Emails will now be sent in
    the background if you configure active\_job to do so. See [the rails guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_job_basics.html#job-execution)
    for more information.

*   Cartons deliveries now send one email per-order, instead of one per-carton.
    This allows setting `@order` and `@store` correctly for the template. For
    most stores, which don't combine multiple orders into a carton, this will
    behave the same.

*   Some HABTM associations have been converted to HMT associations.
    Referential integrity has also been added as well.
    Specifically:

    * Prototype <=> Taxon
    * ShippingMethod <=> Zone
    * Product <=> PromotionRule
