## Solidus 1.1.0 (unreleased)

*   Address is immutable (Address#readonly? is always true)

    This allows us to minimize cloning addresses, while still ensuring historical
    data is preserved.

*   UserAddressBook module added to manage a user's multiple addresses

*   GET /admin/search/users searches all of a user's addresses, not
    just current bill and ship addresss

*   Adjustment state column has been replaced with a finalized boolean column.
    This includes a migration replacing the column, which may cause some
    downtime for large stores.

*   Handlebars templates in the admin are now stored in assets and precompiled
    with the rest of the admin js.

*   Removed `map_nested_attributes_keys` from the Api::BaseController. This
    method was only used in one place and was oblivious of strong_params.
