        # Computes the amount for the adjustment based on the line item and any

        # adjustment are as follows:
        #
        # = Setup
        #
        # We have a quantity group promotion on t-shirts. If a user orders 3
        # t-shirts, they get $5 off of each. The shirts come in one size and three
        # colours: red, blue, and white.
        #
        # == Scenario 1
        #
        # User has 2 red shirts, 1 white shirt, and 1 blue shirt in their
        # order. We want to compute the adjustment amount for the white shirt.
        #
        # *Result:* -$5
        #
        # *Reasoning:* There are a total of 4 items that are eligible for the
        # promotion. Since that is greater than 3, we can discount the items. The
        # white shirt has a quantity of 1, therefore it will get discounted by
        # +adjustment_amount * 1+ or $5.
        #
        # === Scenario 1-1
        #
        # What about the blue shirt? How much does it get discounted?
        #
        # *Result:* $0
        #
        # *Reasoning:* We have a total quantity of 4. However, we only apply the
        # adjustment to groups of 3. Assuming the white and red shirts have already
        # had their adjustment calculated, that means 3 units have been discounted.
        # Leaving us with a lonely blue shirt that isn't part of a group of 3.
        # Therefore, it does not receive the discount.
        #
        # == Scenario 2
        #
        # User has 4 red shirts in their order. What is the amount?
        #
        # *Result:* -$15
        #
        # *Reasoning:* The total quantity of eligible items is 4, so we the
        # adjustment will be non-zero. However, we only apply it to groups of 3,
        # therefore there is one extra item that is not eligible for the
        # adjustment. +adjustment_amount * 3+ or $15.
